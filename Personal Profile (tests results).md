To sum up, these three tests let me have better understanding of myself. All of these results show that I am an outgoing person and with good creativity. Just like the personality test mentioned, my result was ‘ESFJ-A’, which called consul personality.
Based on the introduction for 16 personalities website (NERIS Analytics Limited, n.d.), people with consuls personality are always good at creating and maintaining a stable relationship with their friends. Which means when I work in a team, I will try my best to consider everyone's ideas, and play a good role in maintaining a team. Meanwhile, from the learning style test, the result is ‘Visual’, when complete a project with a team, I will use my advantages to understand the project, visualize all the steps in my mind first, and describe what the whole project looks like. Then I will share my understanding with my teammates.
When building a team, the first word that comes to mind is balance. Maybe some people are good at communication, while others are good at programming or often have creative suggestions. However, in order to complete a project efficiently, our team needs diversity. The results of these tests can be good references, by choose different personalities to maximize each person’s strength.
