The snapshot below shows my ideal job, a data analyst. Simply put, a data analyst is to use their IT skill to make reasonable analyses, speculate, prediction and judgment on the given data. As for me, I have always thought that data is a locked box with a lot of secrets in it, and IT skill is one of the keys for the box. When IT is used reasonably to deal with data, I think this process is full of charm. So, I think data analyst is a very meaningful career.
According to the advertisement, if want to get this job, the first thing need is 2 yearsâ€™ experience as a data analyst, or experience in an IT role. And the second thing is that own some IT skill, like using office software, and having knowledge about SQL and database. Meanwhile, the communication skill and teamwork are also important.
Actually, I have no experience in IT or data analysis for me right now. However, after years of playing basketball with different people, I have confidence in my communication skills. I believe that I can quickly adapt to the new environment and integrate into the new team.
To obtain the requirements of being a data analyst, first thing I need to do is that master relevant IT knowledge. For example, learn to use databases to store and call data, and proficient in SQL. At the same time, maintain an aspirant heart, learn to draw inferences. As for the aspect of experience, I need to pay more attention to some relevant part-time information, through part-time, to accumulate more experience.
