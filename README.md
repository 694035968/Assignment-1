<h1>My Profile</h1>
<h2>Personal information</h2>
My name is Zhan Ruan, student number is s3538828, email is s3538828@student.rmit.edu.au. Seven years ago, I left my motherland China to start my secondary school life in Singapore. And four years ago, I came to Melbourne to chase my university dream. Years of studying abroad experience makes me more independent, and also teach me how to enjoy life. Traveling is one of my interests. In the past years, I have been to Japan, Korea, Malaysia and so on. Traveling in different countries not only broadened my horizon, but also exposed me to different cultures. Moreover, Basketball is one of my favorite sports. In the years in Melbourne, the place I went most often was RMIT A’Beckett Urban Square. I think basketball not only exercise my body, but also help me integrate into the new environment faster. At the same time, I can get to know more friends with different cultures and backgrounds on the basketball court.

<h2>Interest in IT</h2>
I still remember when I was a little boy, I got my first computer from my father as my tenth birthday gift. It was the first time I knew that there was such a magical thing in the world that can make me feel the vastness of the world without leaving home. With my gradual understanding of computer knowledge, I become more interested in IT. Programmers use code to construct a vast virtual world. At the same time, the real world is better and more convenient because of these innovations. I realized that the life in the future will be tightly connected with IT, having basic understanding of information technology is necessary, so, this is why I want to learn more in this field. 

<h2>Why choose RMIT</h2>
For this question, in general, there are three aspects that lead me to make the decision to choose RMIT. First of all, it is the quality of education, based on the QS World University Rankings by Subject 2019: Computer Science & Information Systems, RMIT is in the top 150 universities (QS, 2019), which indicates that RMIT has high level of teaching, and strong faculty. Meanwhile, according to the introduction form RMIT’s website, RMIT has partnership with many famous companies, like Google, ANZ, and IMB. Which means that we can have chance to solve real problem under this kind of industry-connected model. By this way, not only our understanding of IT knowledge will get improve, but also these experiences will be great helpful for our future careers. Furthermore, it is the flexible class time and convenient location. Since the main campus is located in the city, we have lots of choice to take convenient transportation to attend classes.  

<h2>Expect to Learn</h2>
Generally speaking, there are two parts I want to gain during my IT study. On the one hand, it is about some basic information about Information Technology, not only about the background, the history, and the development of IT, but also want to learn some specific knowledge about computer languages. As it is known to us all that there are many computer languages, such as Java, C , C++，C#，python and etc.. However, I want to know how to choose the suitable language with the right environment, and what are the differences between these languages. On the other hand, if I choose to engage in IT in the future, I also want to find a suitable career plan from the unit, such as, what I should do, what skill I should obtain.

<h2>Ideal Job</h2> 
Ideal job link: https://www.seek.com.au/job/39898751?type=standout&searchrequesttoken=e0b4faf5-2f56-4f72-9282-be38499b4dfb
The snapshot below shows my ideal job, a data analyst. Simply put, a data analyst is to use their IT skill to make reasonable analyses, speculate, prediction and judgment on the given data. As for me, I have always thought that data is a locked box with a lot of secrets in it, and IT skill is one of the keys for the box. When IT is used reasonably to deal with data, I think this process is full of charm. So, I think data analyst is a very meaningful career.
According to the advertisement, if want to get this job, the first thing need is 2 years’ experience as a data analyst, or experience in an IT role. And the second thing is that own some IT skill, like using office software, and having knowledge about SQL and database. Meanwhile, the communication skill and teamwork are also important.
Actually, I have no experience in IT or data analysis for me right now. However, after years of playing basketball with different people, I have confidence in my communication skills. I believe that I can quickly adapt to the new environment and integrate into the new team.
To obtain the requirements of being a data analyst, first thing I need to do is that master relevant IT knowledge. For example, learn to use databases to store and call data, and proficient in SQL. At the same time, maintain an aspirant heart, learn to draw inferences. As for the aspect of experience, I need to pay more attention to some relevant part-time information, through part-time, to accumulate more experience.

The results of an online Myers-Briggs test
The test I chose is 16 personalities test, it is based on the Myers-Briggs test. The test result is shown in the snapshot below. And also can be find in this link:

To sum up, these three tests let me have better understanding of myself. All of these results show that I am an outgoing person and with good creativity. Just like the personality test mentioned, my result was ‘ESFJ-A’, which called consul personality.
Based on the introduction for 16 personalities website (NERIS Analytics Limited, n.d.), people with consuls personality are always good at creating and maintaining a stable relationship with their friends. Which means when I work in a team, I will try my best to consider everyone's ideas, and play a good role in maintaining a team. Meanwhile, from the learning style test, the result is ‘Visual’, when complete a project with a team, I will use my advantages to understand the project, visualize all the steps in my mind first, and describe what the whole project looks like. Then I will share my understanding with my teammates.
When building a team, the first word that comes to mind is balance. Maybe some people are good at communication, while others are good at programming or often have creative suggestions. However, in order to complete a project efficiently, our team needs diversity. The results of these tests can be good references, by choose different personalities to maximize each person’s strength. 

<h2>Project idea</h2>
<h3>Overview</h3>
With the popularization of smart phones, people's life is becoming more and more convenient. Many people use mobile applications to accomplish things like taking a taxi. Taking Uber as an example, every day, there are more than 14 million Uber trips are completed (Iqbal, 2019), which means that This shows that uber has a huge user base. However, there are still many people who do not know how to use Uber, or people do not know how to use smart phone, such as the elderly, which makes it inconvenient for such groups to travel. Generally speaking, my project is called ‘Family’. It is a smart phone application, People can use this app to control their family members' phones and help them use some mobile apps, such as Uber, eBay, and other apps.
<h3>Motivation</h3>
According to the report (Span, 2019), half of adults over 65 own smart phones, but less than a quarter use apps like Uber. The main reason is that they don't think these apps are safe, and they're worried that these apps will empty their bank accounts. If they want to go somewhere, they often ask their children to help them make arrangements, book flights, hotels, etc. But if the elderly is out alone, they cannot ask their children to come and help. This is where a remote-control mobile application becomes necessary. Actually, this is a real thing happened in my side. When my parents go to travel, they often need to take a taxi, always seek my help, let me tell them how to use the Uber. Due to I can't determine their precise location, I cannot place an order on Uber for them. This is one of the motivations for me to make this kind of application.
<h3>Description</h3>
In order to better display the features of my project. I made a mockup in Balsamiq. Detailed project introductions are presented in the screenshots below.

Step:1 Login and Register

Figure 1 shows the login in interface, user can login in with their account name and password. Also, can click the register button to register your account.

Step 2: Main Interface

After logging in, you will be taken to the main menu. Just like Figure 2, it contains personal information, family members, add application, application box, log out. Here is the introduction for these labels.

Step 3:  Add Family Member

Figure 3 shows that User A want to invite User B into his/her family group. User A should input User B’s account name, and click confirm. Then，User B will receive a message (Figure 4). If User B clicks ‘Yes’, then he/she will be added into User A’s family group. And can be found in User A’s family member.

Step 4: Add Applications into Box

For example, if users want the family member to help them use Uber to take taxi, they can add Uber in to the Box (Figure 5). And then, Uber will be shown in the Application Box (Figure 6) 

![9](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51431943/66319363-900d7500-e94f-11e9-82b7-6e579c151e03.png)  Figure 5

Step 5 Remote control

When User A needs help, click on the one of family members, a message will pop up (figure 7), and then click ok, the family member will receive a message (Figure 8), and when confirmed, the application in the User A’s application box can be used by family member. In addition, apps like Uber need to use location, which will use the location of User A, not the family member’s.

<h3>Tools, Technologies and Skill Required</h3>
First of all, it needs a computer can run the environment for the XML and Java, the operation system can be Windows 10, and CPU i5 is enough, but i7 is better. RAM needs 8GB or more. Secondly, it needs two smart phones with Android system which are used to test the application. Moreover, it needs the support of database to store the account numbers and other information, so, rent a database if conditions permit. Furthermore, the application involves multiple programs, so it is important to master multiple programming languages, such as XML, JAVA, etc., which will be used to write interfaces, client side, server side, etc.

<h3>Outcome</h3>
The success flag of the project is that user B can use the applications in the user A's app box. Through this project, some users who cannot use some application can enjoy the convenience brought by technology. At the same time, it will expand the user base of some application and bring more profits to these software companies. However, there are also potential risks. The first thing needs to be considered is security. If personal user information is leaked, criminals may use the application to control others' phones and gain illegal profits. Therefore, the safety environment construction of this application needs to be considered in the future.
