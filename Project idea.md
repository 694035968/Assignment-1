# Project idea

## Overview
With the popularization of smart phones, people's life is becoming more and more convenient. Many people use mobile applications to accomplish things like taking a taxi. Taking Uber as an example, every day, there are more than 14 million Uber trips are completed (Iqbal, 2019), which means that This shows that uber has a huge user base. However, there are still many people who do not know how to use Uber, or people do not know how to use smart phone, such as the elderly, which makes it inconvenient for such groups to travel. Generally speaking, my project is called ‘Family’. It is a smart phone application, People can use this app to control their family members' phones and help them use some mobile apps, such as Uber, eBay, and other apps.

## Motivation
According to the report (Span, 2019), half of adults over 65 own smart phones, but less than a quarter use apps like Uber. The main reason is that they don't think these apps are safe, and they're worried that these apps will empty their bank accounts. If they want to go somewhere, they often ask their children to help them make arrangements, book flights, hotels, etc. But if the elderly is out alone, they cannot ask their children to come and help. This is where a remote-control mobile application becomes necessary. Actually, this is a real thing happened in my side. When my parents go to travel, they often need to take a taxi, always seek my help, let me tell them how to use the Uber. Due to I can't determine their precise location, I cannot place an order on Uber for them. This is one of the motivations for me to make this kind of application.
## Description
In order to better display the features of my project. I made a mockup in Balsamiq. Detailed project introductions are presented in the screenshots below.

### Step:1 Login and Register
Figure 1 shows the login in interface, user can login in with their account name and password. Also, can click the register button to register your account.

Figure 1
### Step 2: Main Interface
After logging in, you will be taken to the main menu. Just like Figure 2, it contains personal information, family members, add application, application box, log out. Here is the introduction for these labels.

| Labels | Introduction |
| - | :-: |
| Personal information | Record the user's personal information |
| Family members | Contains the user's family member's account, forms the user group with the family member. Users can also create or cancel connections with new family members. (Figure 3 and 4 will display the operation of creating connection with new family member, Figure 7 will show the operation of user A asking user B to remote control) |
| Add Application | Add apps to the box, which will allow family members to remotely assist (Figure 5 and 6 will show the detail operation) |
| Application box | Contain applications that require remote operations (displayed in Figure 6) |
| Logout | Logout the application |

### Step 3:  Add Family Member
Figure 3 shows that User A want to invite User B into his/her family group. User A should input User B’s account name, and click confirm. Then，User B will receive a message (Figure 4). If User B clicks ‘Yes’, then he/she will be added into User A’s family group. And can be found in User A’s family member.

### Step 4: Add Applications into Box
For example, if users want the family member to help them use Uber to take taxi, they can add Uber in to the Box (Figure 5). And then, Uber will be shown in the Application Box (Figure 6)

Figure 6

### Step 5 Remote control
When User A needs help, click on the one of family members, a message will pop up (figure 7), and then click ok, the family member will receive a message (Figure 8), and when confirmed, the application in the User A’s application box can be used by family member. In addition, apps like Uber need to use location, which will use the location of User A, not the family member’s.

## Tools, Technologies and Skill Required
First of all, it needs a computer can run the environment for the XML and Java, the operation system can be Windows 10, and CPU i5 is enough, but i7 is better. RAM needs 8GB or more. Secondly, it needs two smart phones with Android system which are used to test the application. Moreover, it needs the support of database to store the account numbers and other information, so, rent a database if conditions permit. Furthermore, the application involves multiple programs, so it is important to master multiple programming languages, such as XML, JAVA, etc., which will be used to write interfaces, client side, server side, etc.

## Outcome
The success flag of the project is that user B can use the applications in the user A's app box. Through this project, some users who cannot use some application can enjoy the convenience brought by technology. At the same time, it will expand the user base of some application and bring more profits to these software companies. However, there are also potential risks. The first thing needs to be considered is security. If personal user information is leaked, criminals may use the application to control others' phones and gain illegal profits. Therefore, the safety environment construction of this application needs to be considered in the future.
