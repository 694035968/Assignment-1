Personal information

My name is Zhan Ruan, student number is s3538828, email is s3538828@student.rmit.edu.au. Seven years ago, I left my motherland China to start my secondary school life in Singapore. And four years ago, I came to Melbourne to chase my university dream. Years of studying abroad experience makes me more independent, and also teach me how to enjoy life. Traveling is one of my interests. In the past years, I have been to Japan, Korea, Malaysia and so on. Traveling in different countries not only broadened my horizon, but also exposed me to different cultures. Moreover, Basketball is one of my favorite sports. In the years in Melbourne, the place I went most often was RMIT Aâ€™Beckett Urban Square. I think basketball not only exercise my body, but also help me integrate into the new environment faster. At the same time, I can get to know more friends with different cultures and backgrounds on the basketball court.
